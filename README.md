# Netflix homepage recreation (RISOFLIX) ðŸ“½

In this project I recreated the Netflix login page. Following the recommendation of the platform, I made the project with my own theme. I chose to use Brazilian humor classics in the composition because I decided to make the website in Portuguese and as a tribute to Fernanda Young and Paulo Gustavo, late brazilian artists.
To structure the layout it was used Netflix as a reference, CSS3 techniques with containers and variables, position elements with Flexbox and JQuery plugins to make the carousel. 

### Changes:

* Made my own Netflix with a different theme
* Add a second carousel to make the page more interesting
* Used accessibility attributes like "alt" on images and "title" on buttons
* Added description elements to improve the site's search performance (learned with Rocketseat platform)
* I added a footer after searching about on Stackoverflow
* Added social media link buttons


\* It is not a totally identical clone, it was made for study purposes only.
